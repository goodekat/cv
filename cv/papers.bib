abstract = {Abstract Three species of invasive carp—Grass Carp Ctenopharyngodon idella, Silver Carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, and Bighead Carp H. nobilis—are rapidly spreading throughout North America. Monitoring their reproduction can help to determine establishment in new areas but is difficult due to challenges associated with identifying fish eggs. Recently, random forest models provided accurate identification of eggs based on morphological traits, but the models have not been validated using independent data. Our objective was to evaluate the predictive performance of egg identification models developed by Camacho et al. (2019) for classifying invasive carp eggs by using an independent data set. When invasive carp were grouped as one category, predictive accuracy was high at the following levels: family (89\%), genus (90\%), species (91\%), and species with reduced predictor variables (94\%). Invasive carp predictive accuracy decreased when we only considered observations from newly sampled locations (family: 9\%; genus: 22\%; species: 30\%; species with reduced predictor variables: 70\%), suggesting potential differences in egg characteristics among locations. Random forest models using a combination of previous and new data resulted in high predictive accuracy for invasive carp (96–98\%) when invasive carp were grouped as one class for all models at the family, genus, and species levels. The two most influential predictor variables were average membrane diameter and average embryo diameter; the probability of predicting an invasive carp egg increased with these metrics. High predictive accuracy metrics suggest that these trained and validated random forest models can be used to identify invasive carp eggs based on morphometric variables. However, decreased performance at new locations suggests that more research would be beneficial to determine the models’ applicability to a larger spatial region.},

abstract={In the past decade, nuclear chemists and physicists have been conducting studies to investigate the signatures associated with the production of special nuclear material (SNM). In particular, these studies aim to determine how various processing parameters impact the physical, chemical, and morphological properties of the resulting special nuclear material. By better understanding how these properties relate to the processing parameters, scientists can better contribute to nuclear forensics investigations by quantifying their results and ultimately shortening the forensic timeline. This paper aims to statistically analyze and quantify the relationships that exist between the processing conditions used in these experiments and the various properties of the nuclear end-product by invoking inverse methods. In particular, these methods make use of Bayesian Adaptive Spline Surface models in conjunction with Bayesian model calibration techniques to probabilistically determine processing conditions as an inverse function of morphological characteristics. Not only does the model presented in this paper allow for providing point estimates of a sample of special nuclear material, but it also incorporates uncertainty into these predictions. This model proves sufficient for predicting processing conditions within a standard deviation of the observed processing conditions, on average, provides a solid foundation for future work in predicting processing conditions of particles of special nuclear material using only their observed morphological characteristics, and is generalizable to the field of chemometrics for applicability across different materials.}

abstract = {Abstract The importance of providing explanations for predictions made by black-box models has led to the development of explainer model methods such as LIME (local interpretable model-agnostic explanations). LIME uses a surrogate model to explain the relationship between predictor variables and predictions from a black-box model in a local region around a prediction of interest. However, the quality of the resulting explanations relies on how well the explainer model captures the black-box model in a specified local region. Here we introduce three visual diagnostics to assess the quality of LIME explanations: (1) explanation scatterplots, (2) assessment metric plots, and (3) feature heatmaps. We apply the visual diagnostics to a forensics bullet matching dataset to show examples where LIME explanations depend on the tuning parameter values and the explainer model oversimplifies the black-box model. Our examples raise concerns about claims made of LIME that are similar to other criticisms in the literature.},

abstract = {Abstract Age-0 Walleye Sander vitreus are stocked to achieve several management objectives. However, stocked Walleye are exposed to numerous handling- and transport-related stressors that can negatively influence disease resistance, survival, year-class strength, and fisheries management objectives. The objective of this study was to evaluate relationships between Walleye transport duration with changes in water chemistry, whole-blood glucose and plasma cortisol concentrations, and short-term (48-h) mortality. Walleye were transported between 3.5 and 6.0 h and stocked into holding cages located at one of seven sites. Water quality and stress (via whole-blood glucose and plasma cortisol) and mortality were evaluated prior to, during, and at 0, 2, 24, and 48 h posttransportation. During transport, water temperatures generally decreased, while carbon dioxide concentrations fluctuated between 2.7 and 22.5 mg/L. Walleye whole-blood glucose and plasma cortisol concentrations varied by site and time since transport. Changes in carbon dioxide concentrations were associated with changes in whole-blood glucose concentrations. However, cumulative survival rates and plasma cortisol concentrations were not associated with water quality or transportation duration. Understanding Walleye tolerance to transportation-induced stress has the potential to enhance stocking programs by providing the opportunity for managers to make informed transport decisions.},
